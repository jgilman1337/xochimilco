# xochimilco

The [lake Xochimilco][wiki-xochimilco] seems to be the last native habitat for the [axolotl][wiki-axolotl].
This salamander, also called _Mexican walking fish_, has incredibly self healing abilities.
For this reason, the [Double Ratchet Algorithm][signal-double-ratchet] was initially named after this animal.

This repository contains an implementation of some [Signal protocols][signal-docs].
